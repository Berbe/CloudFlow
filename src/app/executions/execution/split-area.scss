/**
Major UI repaint issues when settings the overflow values of the split-area component.
(done automatically by the angular-split library).

A workaround is to unset them, and set them back after finishing drawing the graph.

We also had to set the z-index of the rightmost panel to "2"
so the graph will not, well, overflow on that panel.
